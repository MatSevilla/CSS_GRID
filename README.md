CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that enables the creation of grid-based designs with rows and columns. It simplifies web page construction by eliminating the need for floats and positioning techniques.

This CSS_GRID project repository will showcase how to implement a CSS grid, either internally or inline, within an HTML document using the "style" attribute. By setting an HTML element's "display" property to "grid," it becomes a grid container. Additionally, various properties are applied to improve the grid's visual presentation.
